Hello! 👋 My name is Sellyna (Se-le-na)

I am a developer with a passion for building, collaboration and learning. 

My strengths resides in front end development using React JS and Sass in projects to build interfaces and their functionalities, as well as, making the connection to fetch data using Node & Express Js. Although my strength is in front end, I have a keen interest to learn and upskill in back end development. 

I have been studying in Mission Ready where I have successfully completed both Level 4 (Full Stack Developer) and Level 5 (Advance Software Developer). I am currently in the process of completing Mission Ready's Level 6 internship placement.

Technologies I want and aim to learn:
- 🦋 Typescript
- 🎀 Scss/Sass - used Sass in my final project in Mission Ready!
- 🍀 Vue JS
- 🍊 Swift (Hopefully...)
- 🔮 .NET
