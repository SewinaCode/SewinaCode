Hello! 👋 My name is Sellyna (Se-le-na)

I am apart of the career changer group - making a switch to tech, specifying in software development.

In the exploration in software development, I found my interest and passion in Front End with a goal to build mobile applications in the future. 

- I have recently completed a Full Stack Developer course that required me to learn React JS, Node & Express JS and MYSQL. 
- I learned to fetch data from a custom database made in MYSQL workbench. 
- I am in the middle of an Advance Developer course by Mission Ready HQ

Technologies I want and aim to learn:
- 🦋 Typescript
- 🎀 Scss/Sass
- 🍀 Vue JS
- 🍊 Swift (Hopefully...)

Fun fact about me:
I build custom keyboards and bookbind in my free time AND I LOVE CATS 🐈 🐈‍⬛
